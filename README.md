# PythonWSDownloaderClient

The client to use the Websocket filesharing.

## How to use

### If you want to share files:

**You have to forward port 8765.** 
A forwardless method (NAT hole punching) will be implemented as alternative eventually.

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
python src/main.py
```

### If you want to download files:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
python src/main.py
```
